# Search-Engine
* A custom search engine was built to retrieve information from a corpus made up of 1000 unique 
wikipedia urls.
* The retrieval models implemented in the search engine are TF-IDF, BM25 ranking algorithm and 
LUCENE.
* Techniques like stopping, stemming and query expansion using psuedo relevance feedback were used 
to improve the performance of the retrieval model.
* The retrieval models were evaluated using techniques like Precision, Recall, MAP, MRR.
* The readme.txt file contains the steps to run the project.
